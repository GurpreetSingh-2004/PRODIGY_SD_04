Description of the Sudoku Solver Program
Overview
The Sudoku Solver Program is a console-based application designed to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles. It takes an unsolved Sudoku grid as input, applies a backtracking algorithm to explore possible solutions, and outputs the completed grid. The program is efficient and can handle various Sudoku configurations, ensuring that it adheres to the rules of the game.

Features
Input Grid:

The program accepts an unsolved Sudoku grid, where empty cells are represented by zeroes (0).
Users can input the grid in a specified format (e.g., row by row) or read it from a file.
Backtracking Algorithm:

The core of the solver is based on the backtracking technique, which systematically explores possible placements for each empty cell.
The algorithm checks each possible number (1-9) for validity and places the number in the cell if it adheres to Sudoku rules (no duplicate in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).
If the algorithm reaches a dead end (i.e., no valid number can be placed in an empty cell), it backtracks to the previous cell and tries the next number.
Output Solution:

Once the puzzle is solved, the program displays the completed Sudoku grid in a user-friendly format.
If the program determines that no solution exists for the given input, it informs the user.
Implementation
Data Structure:

The Sudoku grid is represented as a 2D array or vector of integers.
Each cell can contain a number from 1 to 9 or a zero to represent an empty cell.
Algorithm Logic:

The program includes functions for:
Checking if a number can be placed in a specific cell (isSafe function).
Finding the next empty cell in the grid (findEmptyLocation function).
Solving the puzzle recursively (solveSudoku function).
The main function coordinates user input, invokes the solver, and displays the results.
User Interface:

The program operates through a command-line interface, guiding the user through the input and output processes.
Users can easily enter the Sudoku puzzle in a structured format, and the program outputs the completed puzzle in a readable format.
